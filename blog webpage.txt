        <h2>My First Post - March 1, 2025</h2>
        <p>This is my first blog post. I can write as much as I want here. Like, seriously, no limit. I could talk about my day, my cat, or how I’m learning to code this website. Here’s a long random story: One day I went to the store and saw a bird, and it reminded me of a dream I had where I was flying, but then I fell into a giant sandwich. Weird, right? Anyway, this is just an example.</p>

        <h2>My Second Post - March 2, 2025</h2>
        <p>Here’s another post. I can keep adding these forever. Today I ate a pizza and thought about life. No word limit means I can ramble on and on about the cheese and how it was stretchy and perfect.</p>
